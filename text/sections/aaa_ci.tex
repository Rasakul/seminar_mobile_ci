\section{Mobile CI/CD example: AllAboutApps pipeline}
After looking into what options there are to define a CI/CD pipeline for mobile applications, this section will now evaluate this with an existing pipeline at AllAboutApps, how a concrete implementation looks like and how it can be improved to fully apply as CI/CD pipeline.

\subsection{Current state}
The current setup is based on Bitrise and an automated Google Play Store deployment. The current workflow/pipeline looks as follows:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Checkout \texttt{master} branch
	\item Create \texttt{feature} branch
	\item Implement feature, commit as atomic as possible
	\item Local builds
	\item Bitrise trigger for push: \texttt{debug} build
	\item If feature fulfills internal \textit{Definition of Done}: pull request
	\item After pull request approval: merge to \texttt{master}
	\item Bitrise trigger for \texttt{master}: release \& preview build
	\item If everything successful: upload to \texttt{internal} or \texttt{alpha} track of Google Play
	\item QA is testing last master build
	\item After QA \& customer approval: promotion to \texttt{release} track in Google Play\\
\end{itemize}

As we can see, this workflow already covers most of the CI/CD steps, but misses some crucial points. In order to analyze how this can be improved to a fully implemented CI/CD pipeline, we will use the previously introduced adopted checklist of Fowler:\\

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item \textbf{Maintain a Single Source Repository}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] \texttt{Git} is common practice at the company \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Make Your Build Self-Testing}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\notdone] No automated testing
		\item[\notdone] No testing culture
		\item Bitrise would support it \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Everyone Commits Every Day}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] Common practice at the company \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] Yes by Bitrise push triggers\\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Keep the Build Fast}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] Inherited due to the \texttt{Gradle} build system for Android \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Test in an Emulated Environment}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\notdone] No automated testing
		\item Bitrise would support it (all of UI, integration and unit testing) \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Make it Easy for Anyone to Get the Latest Executable}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] Yes, by Bitrise build artifacts \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Everyone can see what's happening}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item[\done] Covered by Bitrise - everyone has access to the current build states of the projects \\
	\end{todolist}

	\item \textbf{Automate Deployment}
	\begin{todolist}
		\item Yes, automated deployement to Google Play \texttt{internal} or \texttt{alpha} track, manual deployement to \texttt{release} \\
	\end{todolist}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Missing steps}
We don't test :/

Hui, nobody knows!
