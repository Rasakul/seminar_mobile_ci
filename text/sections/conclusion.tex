\section{Summary}
We have seen how a mobile CI/CD pipeline look like in theory. Further we discussed which requirements this process have to cover as well as which tools are available to implement such a pipeline. We then applied this gather information to a case study of a pipeline in a mobile software development company. 

The overworked pipeline was proposed to the company - but there are currently no further information of how much of the recommended changes were actually implemented.
