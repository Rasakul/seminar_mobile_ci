CI/CD is a known and well-used process for a majority of software projects - but not yet in the mobile world. In this paper we will take a closer look how CI/CD differs from the "classical" CI/CD definition. The mobile world is heavily dominated by the two major OS Android and iOS - both having their own CI/CD approaches. This paper will only cover the Android way and which official recommendations Google gives. For Apple sources we recommend the official Apple resources as a starting point into the topic.

This paper will then apply the gather information in a case study of a mobile software development, developing a prototype pipeline together with a workflow ready to use. The final Bitrise configuration utilizing this process can be found in the Appendix~\ref{bitrise_config}.
